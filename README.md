# Personal Signature Detector: a machine learning handwritten signature classifier

In this machine elarning project we train a model capable of identifying an image of a particular signature from a group of different signature images. The repository contains: a Jupyter Notebook with the tutorial, the raw code for code editor, and a csv file to populate with a .zip document containing 160 images and a requirements txt file.
